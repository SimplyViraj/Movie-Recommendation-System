# 🎬 Movie Recommendation System
> Note: Please go through the code.ipynb since it has all the markdowns with a detailed description from preprocessing to testing.

## 📌 Overview

The movie recommendation system has become an essential tool in enhancing user experiences on streaming platforms by delivering personalized content suggestions. This project presents a robust movie recommendation engine that combines **Content-Based Filtering (CBF)** and **Collaborative Filtering (CF)** techniques to provide accurate, user-specific movie recommendations.

By leveraging user-item interaction data, the system identifies viewing patterns and preferences, enabling it to recommend movies that align with individual tastes.

## 🛠️ Features

* Hybrid recommendation approach using:

  * Matrix Factorization
  * Deep Learning models
* Supports **Collaborative Filtering** and **Neural Collaborative Filtering (NCF)**
* Captures complex user-item relationships using neural networks
* Tested on a **public movie dataset**
* Evaluated using the **Normalized Discounted Cumulative Gain (NDCG)** metric

---

## 📊 Evaluation

The system demonstrates improved recommendation accuracy over traditional methods. NDCG results show that both CF and NCF methods are effective for personalized recommendations.
